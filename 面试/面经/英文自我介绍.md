My name is ZhangZhaoyuan.I graduated from 
Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018. Now I am working as a Software Engineer in Commercial Platform department of Xiaomi.I'm familiar with Java,Spring,SpringBoot,Mysql,Redis,Thrift,Zookeeper,Kafka and I have some experience in Big Data including Spark,Flink.

During 2 years in XiaoMi, I have attened 2 projects.The first one is oCPX Advertising delivery system which includes Attribution System, oCPX DSP, PID system and so on.

Attribution System is to match click,download events with conversion events which is important to determining the Effects of Advertising. There are two kind of different Kafka streams,one for click and download events and the other for conversion events.We have a service to consume the first stream, and then store it in the K-V database, and then the consumer of conversion events will read the data from the K-V database for matching.The results of attribution are used for OLAP and CVR model training

DSP is a ad delivery enginewhich contains the life cycle of an ad named Pipeline. A pipeline includes several steps such as recall, budget control, budget smoothing, filtering, and sorting.

pid service makes the actual cost of ad close to the target cost by adjusting the bid of ad which is multiplied by three parts: ctr, cvr and ocpa.Pid adjust ocpa in real time.The pid formula contains three terms proportional, integral, and derivative terms 


Another project is ad diagnosis platform, I am responsible for the analysis of the root causes of income fluctuations.By calculating the coefficient of variation of each dimension by layer, the problematic dimension is obtained as the root cause. Then join it with some data, including operation log, funnel data, ctr,cvr etc..
